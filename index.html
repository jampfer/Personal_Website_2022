        <p>I am 22 years old and will be graduating from NKU in the spring of 2023. Throughout my time at NKU, I have accomplished many things. My Junior year,
		I was one of the Head Orientation Leaders where I managed and oversaw a staff of 31 Orientation Leaders. Together, we facilitated 17 orientation programs
		for first time freshmen, in total serving over 1,000 incoming students. Currently, I am the social media and communications intern for the Office of 
		Admissions at NKU where I create and post content that showcases the best parts of the University. Upon graduation, I plan to attend grad school at
		NKU in the fall where I will study Business Informatics with a focus in Analytics.</p>

		<p>I have extensive experience in Office Suite. In Excel, I've created spreadsheets to document and solve different business problems. I have experience
		with Solver and chart & graph creation. 
		I've also designed and presented my own Powerpoint Presentations in front of audiences of 40+ people.</p>

		<p>I spent a semester with Tableau during the spring of 2022 at NKU. In the course, I learned how to design intutive and engaging dashboards.
		Ultimately, the class concluded when my team and I completed a project for St. Vincent DePaul in which we visualized their pharmacy dataset
		to discover patterns in their business. During my time at NKU, I have also created and posted content for 3 social media accounts accross 
		multiple platforms. These accounts include @BeaNorse, @nkusigep, and @nkuorientation. I've used Canva and Google Forms to spotlight 
		different people in each organization and design posts that cater to the needs of each individual account.</p>

		<p>As one of the Head Orientation Leaders, I presented in front of groups of 200 students and families during all of NKU's summer Orientation programs.
		I have also facilitated over 30 tours of NKU as an admissions employee. This means that I am very comfortable presenting in front of large groups of 
		people.</p>

    <section class=center id="Hobbies">
        <!--a fourth section in which you share your hobbies and favorite activities (e.g., your favorite bands), using 4-8 images.-->
		<h1>Hobbies and Favorite Activities</h1>
		<p>I have a variety of different hobbies and favorite activities. Let's check them out!</p>
		<h3>Playing the drums</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img class="image-xlg" src="assets/img/drum.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/drum2.png"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>I love playing the drums. I got my first drumset when I was a senior in high school and have been playing ever since. After moving into an
			apartment, I quickly discovered that drumsets become much louder when played in the garage. Because of this, I got an electric kit, which is much quieter
			and allows for headphones. While it does not come close to the sensation of playing real drums, I enjoy discovering the various different 
			pre-loaded sounds and music clips stored in the instrument's memory.</p>
		<h3>Listening to Music</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/beatles.jpg"/>
					&nbsp
					<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/zeppelin.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/thundercat.jpg"/>
					&nbsp
					<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/otis.jfif"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Listening to music is one of my favorite pastimes. Whether it's doing homework, driving to work, or cooking dinner, I love to have music
			accompany my life. Some of my favorite groups and artists include The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Thundercat, and Otis McDonald.</p>
		<h3>Playing the Piano</h3>
			<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/piano.png"/>
			<p>In my spare time, I also like to play the piano. Though I don't know how to site-read, you can find me learning new songs through YouTube
			videos or Synthesia tutorials. Paul McCartney is one of my big inspirations for piano playing. Some of my favorite songs to play include
			<i>Martha My Dear </i> by The Beatles, <i>Nineteen-Hundred and Eighty-Five </i> by Wings, and <i>Listen to What the Man Said </i> by Wings.</p>
		<h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
			<img class="image-lg" src="assets/img/earthbound.jpg"/>
			<p>Occasionally, I will play some video games in my spare time. Recently, I've started the game <i>Earthbound </i> for the Super Nintendo.
			Originally an obscure RPG from the 1990's, Earthbound has grown into a cult classic since its release nearly 30 years ago. I also enjoy
			Super Smash Bros, F-Zero, and Super Mario Party.</p>
